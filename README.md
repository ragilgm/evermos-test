Question :


We are members of the engineering team of an online store. When we look at ratings for our online store application, we received the following
facts:
Customers were able to put items in their cart, check out, and then pay. After several days, many of our customers received calls from
our Customer Service department stating that their orders have been canceled due to stock unavailability.
These bad reviews generally come within a week after our 12.12 event, in which we held a large flash sale and set up other major
discounts to promote our store.
After checking in with our Customer Service and Order Processing departments, we received the following additional facts:
Our inventory quantities are often misreported, and some items even go as far as having a negative inventory quantity.
The misreported items are those that performed very well on our 12.12 event.
Because of these misreported inventory quantities, the Order Processing department was unable to fulfill a lot of orders, and thus
requested help from our Customer Service department to call our customers and notify them that we have had to cancel their orders.
Based on the stated facts above, please do the following things:
Describe what you think happened that caused those bad reviews during our 12.12 event and why it happened. Put this in a section in
your README.md file.
Based on your analysis, propose a solution that will prevent the incidents from occurring again. Put this in a section in your README.md
file.
Based on your proposed solution, build a Proof of Concept that demonstrates technically how your solution will work.


MY Opinion :

The problem occurred because there were concurrent transactions and a reduction in the number of items was carried out at the end after the payment was completed, which resulted in an error in reducing stock


Solution :

Suppose we have 3 variables below
stock available
stock on hold
stock sold out

when the user checkout process: check stock availability, if stock is available, move the value from stock available -> stock on hold

wait until the payment deadline

if the payment is successful
update stock from on hold -> stock sold out

if the payment is not made until the deadline
then return the stock from stock on hold -> stock available
